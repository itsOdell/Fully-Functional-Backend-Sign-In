  </li>
  <li>you have been taken to the sign-in page, enter the exact same crednetials as the one you used to sign up</li>

<h2>all of the data (all the accounts that have been signed up) will diminsh once you've exited the terminal/cmd prompt or typed in "Alt + c" in the vscode integrated terminal.
 This stops the localhost (meaning you wouldnt be able to access the website anymore [unless you followed step 1 - 3 all over again] and all the saved data would be erased)</h2>

<p>and that is how you use</p>
